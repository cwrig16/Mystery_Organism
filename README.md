# Mystery_Organism
The Mystery_Organism project generates instances of an object using a factory function.  
Each instance is comprised of an ID, randomly generated DNA sequence, and methods to mutate the sequence, compare sequences between instances, and 
predict if the instance will survive.  
A function is also included to generate 30 instances which are predicted to survive.  These 30 instances can be used for further evaluation.
